# Install instructions

Add all of your install instructions here if you require anything else than the standard ROS stack.

# Launch

Add ALL of your required launchfiles in the launch folder.
In the end, we will only call the bringup.launch. So if you create "smaller" launchfiles for subcomponents like the localization or navigation, 
make sure to include them in the bringup.launch file.
