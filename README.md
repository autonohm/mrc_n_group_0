# mrc_n_group_0

Template repository for the MRC-N workshop

# Create your own repo based on this

Please use your own user and the "fork" option from git to create your own repository based on this template.
Make sure to rename it to your group ID and remember to adjust the CMakeList.txt and package.xml.


# Install instructions

Add all of your install instructions here if you require anything else than the standard ROS stack.

# Launch

Add ALL of your required launchfiles in the launch folder.
In the end, we will only call the complete.launch. So if you create "smaller" launchfiles for subcomponents like the localization or navigation, 
make sure to include them in the complete.launch file.
