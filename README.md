# Install instructions

Add all of your install instructions here if you require anything else than the standard ROS stack.

# Launch

Add ALL of your required launchfiles in the launch folder.
In the end, we will only call the complete.launch. So if you create "smaller" launchfiles for subcomponents like the localization or navigation, 
make sure to include them in the complete.launch file.
